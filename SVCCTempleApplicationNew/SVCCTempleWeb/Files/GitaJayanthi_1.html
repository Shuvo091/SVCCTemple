            Gita Mahotsav is an event centred around the Bhagavad Gita, celebrated on the Shukla Ekadashi, the 11th day of the waxing moon of the Margashirsha (Agrahayan) month of the Hindu calendar. It is believed the Bhagavad Gita was revealed to Arjuna by Krishna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The text is written in the third person, narrated by Sanjaya to King Dhritarashtra as it transpired between Krishna and Arjuna. Sanjaya, the scribe of the blind King Dhritarashtra, was blessed by his guru, Ved Vyasa, with the power to remotely view the events taking place on the battlefield as they transpired
            <h2>Gita story​</h2>
            In the epic Mahabharata, the story of the Bhagavad Gita takes place just before the start of the Kurukshetra War. After several attempts at reconciliation failed, war was inevitable. Out of pure compassion and sincere love for his devotee and best friend, Arjuna, Lord Krishna decided to become his charioteer during the battle. The day of the war finally came, and the armies faced off on the field of war. Just as the battle was about to start, Arjuna asked Lord Krishna to drive the chariot to the middle of the battlefield, between the armies, to look more closely at the opposing forces. Seeing his grandfather, Bhishma, who raised him with great affection since childhood, and his teacher, Dronācārya, who had trained him to become the greatest archer, Arjuna's heart began to melt. His body started to tremble and his mind got confused. He became unable to perform his duty as a Kshatriya (warrior). He felt weak and sickened at the thought that he would have to kill his relatives, his friends and revered persons in this confrontation. Despondent, he told Krishna of his sudden change of heart and turned to him for advice. The conversation that ensued, Lord Krishna's advice, messages and teachings to Arjuna, is what is known now as the Bhagavad Gita, the ancient scripture and philosophical work.
            <h2>Gita Aarti</h2>
            The Bhagavad Gita Aarti (Hindi: भगवद गीता आरती) or Gita Aarti] is a prayer found in the Sreemad Bhagavad Gita shastra.
            <br /><br />
            The aarti can be spoken, or sung with musical instruments to give more effect to worship. Aartis are usually performed at the end of the puja ritual. It is said that if there was any flaw in the puja, it may be fulfilled by the aarti
