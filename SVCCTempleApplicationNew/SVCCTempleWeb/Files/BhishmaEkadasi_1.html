Sri Vishnu Sahasra
 Nama was revealed in the month of Magha, according to lunar calendar, on the
 11th day of waxing moon, that is sukla paksha ekadasi which comes exactly after
 2 months of Githopadesa. Bheeshma Ekadasi is an auspicious occasion, the birth
 day of Sri Vishnu Sahasra Nama Sthothram. This sthothram was revealed to
 Pandavas by Bheeshmacharya when he was on the bed of arrows, after the
 Mahabharatha war. Lord Krishna revealed Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. Though Arjuna
 was able to converse with Lord Krishna and clear many of his doubts, he
 couldn't absorb it completely as-it-is from the view point of the Lord.
 <br /><br />
 Fortunately, Sanjaya who is televiewing and explaining the happenings of the
 war to the blind King Dhrutharashtra was able to view this upadesam also
 through whom Bhagavad Githa came into this world. Ekadasi day(11th day of the
 full/new moon phase) is considered to be very holy day
 on which devotees take minimum food and spend most of their time contemplating
 on the Lord. It is the day on which the Saththvik nature in man blossoms more
 easily and opens up the way for one's enlightenment. How fortunate we are if we
 are with our Acharya taking upadesam from Him about the best of the secrets a
 man needs to know in his life !!

 In the Kurukshethra war, between Pandavas and Kauravas, Krishna was the
 sarathi(charioteer) for Arjuna. After the day's battle, when they returned to
 the camp, Arjuna asked Krishna to get down and open the gate. This request
 baffled Krishna as He did not get the respect of a Guru who taught him Bhagavad
 Gita. Hence He concluded that, all His teaching was a waste. Then Krishna
 decided to choose an acharya who can teach dharma to Pandavas. According to
 Bhagavad Gita’s Chapter 4 sloka 34, Thath viddhi pranipathena pariprasnena
 sevaya Upadekshyanthi the jnanam jnaninah thathva-darsinaha The path of
 spiritual realization is difficult. Krishna therefore advises Pandavas to
 approach an enlightened master for the realization of dharma. The above sloka
 dictates the principle behavior of a student, to his teacher, before anything
 could be learnt from the master. The student should surrender and this should
 be shown by a few activities which are dictated in the sloka. Prostrating
 before
 Guru, without any inhibition or ego Pranipatha. When the students are being
 taught, the disciple should be able to understand the essence of all those
 teachings. Thus, if the student gets a doubt, he should wait for the proper
 time and present them before his Guru in a prescribed way Pariprasnena. Gurus’
may not clarify the doubts at once, at times they wait few months or even years
 to test the disciples’ commitment and curiosity, and it may take a long time to
 get the answers. Till then the student should serve the master in a pleasing
 way which is called the "seva". Atlast the teacher who is a seer of the truth
 will reveal the ultimate secrets. Krishna realizes that the most eligible
 person to talk about the ultimate truth would be Bheeshma, who at that time was
 lying on the bed of arrows in the battlefield, ready to leave his mortal body.
 Krishna took Pandavas to Bheeshma and requested pithamaha(grandsire) to teach
 the Pandavas about the Ultimate Truth and Dharma. Krishna
 promised pithamaha that He would restore his memory that was buried deep due to
 the pains in his body.

 As it was imparted from a great acharya chosen by the Lord Himself, Sri Vishnu
 Sahasra Nama is considered the essence of Gita and all the Vedas.
 Bheeshmacharya was lying on the bed of arrows after being put down by Arjuna
 during the war. After the war, Pandavas approached Bheeshma to teach them the
 higher principles of life and wisdom, from all his great experiences. Bheeshma
 who is a great Man of Action and Sacrifice, mastered the whole Dharma Sastra
 and practiced it strictly throughout his life. Even the Lord of Death feared to
 approach Bheeshma without his permission. Dharmaraja asks him to tell them the
 greatest of the secrets that made him so great and that he thinks is the best
 that can liberate all beings from the cycle of births and deaths and lead them
 to planes of highest Happiness, Bliss, The Lord. Then Bheeshmacharya having
 obtained boon from Lord Krishna to be able to speak in clear voice and memorise
 his past deeds reveals the essence of all that he learnt from a
 number of sages who had the vision of Lord in different forms. Bheeshma observed
 a number of austerities imposed by the sages, served them for long periods,
 satisfied them that he deserves to be taught the secret they have obtained
 after strenuous efforts, and finally obtained from them the secrets. Like a
 honey bee that collects the honey drops from all the flowers, Bheeshmacharya
 collected all the manthras from different sages and composed Sri Vishnu
 Sahasranama Sthothram which he used to practice daily. When Dharmaraja asked
 him to reveal the greatest of secrets, Bheeshma reveals this to Pandavas on
 Magha Suddha Ekadasi day in presence of Lord Krishna, showing Him and telling
 them that He is Lord of all Lords and praying Him with all 1000 names is all
 one can ever do to become more dear to Him which itself leads to salvation.
 Reciting it regularly or even listening to it is itself a great thing that
 empowers one with the strength to overcome all the difficulties and get on to
 the
 right path of Salvation.
