This puja is very simple, can be performed by anyone, and it does not require a priest to perform it. The original concept was instructions given by rishi Narada Muni while on tour of earth he noticed tremendous amounts of sufferings all around due to malnutrition. He went to lord Vishnu and described the situation and was told with instructions to perform Pooja and the other stories to be narrated. One of the key instruction was to invite as many friends, relatives and neighbors to attend the ceremony and to feed them and to offer as many types of fruits as possible and the sufferings will be eliminated, and this was due to being well fed and consumption of fruits.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
The following procedure is as prescribed by and performed in Andhra Pradesh. Several regional and traditional variations occur as mentioned in the following section.
<br /><br />
The devotee begins by purifying oneself (achamniyam) and sankalpam (a vow that the named devotee is performing the puja on such time and era, to attain such cause).
<br /><br />
The puja starts with a prayer to Gaṇesha, to remove all obstacles that may occur as a result of incorrectly performing the puja. This is done by the sixteen upacharas, chanting the names of Lord Gaṇesha and offering prasada (offering usually consisting of banana, coconut, modak, a sugar and coconut mixture, or laddu) and the showering of flowers. Subsequently Varuna puja (kalash puja) is performed.
<br /><br />
A uniqueness of this puja is the invoking of pancha lokapalaka, navagrahas along with their companion and co-companions, and the eight dikpalakas. This totals to 40 (5+9+(9*2)+8). Each God has a vedic symbol of a unique metal. Since these are difficult to obtain by the common means, and since the modern currency coins by minted with multiple metals, each Guest God is represented by a coin. They are placed on a betel leaf. The betel nut, akshit and dry dates are the offerings. Thus, the requirement of 40 coins, betel leaves and dry dates.
<br /><br />
The main puja commences with the worship to Lord Satyanarayana. The idol (or coin) of Lord Satyanarayana is bathed and cleaned with panchamritam. After placing the deity in the correct position, 1008 names of Sri Satyanarayana are chanted.
<br /><br />
This is followed by offering of Prasada and flowers (Mantra Pushpam).
<br /><br />
Another requirement of the puja is that the story be heard among all those observing and partaking in the puja.
<br /><br />
The five-part story involves the origin of the puja, benefits of the puja, the potential mishaps that may occur with the forgetting performance of the puja, the magnitude of the Lord’s benevolence and the importance of the Prasad, and consequences of snubbing the ritual.
<br /><br />
The puja concludes with an Aarti , which consists of lighting camphor in the vicinity of an image of the Lord.
<br /><br />
After the puja is over, participants and observers of the puja are required to partake the prasad that was offered and blessed by the Lord.
<h3>Regional and Traditional Variations</h3>
Many places the Varuna/ Kalash puja is done while invoking Ganesh at the start of the puja.
<br /><br />
The number of Athitis (divine guests) invoked varies substantially. Thus, the number of coins and betel leaves count varies.
<h2>Sri Satyanarayana Swami Katha</h2>
An essential part of this puja is listening to the Sri Satyanarayana Swami Katha (narrative).
<br /><br />
The five-part story involves the origin of the puja, benefits of the puja, the potential mishaps that may occur with the forgetting performance of the puja, the magnitude of the Lord’s benevolence and the importance of the Prasad, and consequences of snubbing the ritual.
<br /><br />
Chapter 1 narrates the origins of the puja. Sri Satyanarayana Katha comes from the Skanda Puraṇa, Reva khaṇḍa. Suta Maharṣhi is the one narrating this account to Saunaka Muni, in Naimiṣaraṇya to the ṛiṣhis who were performing a thousand year yajna for the benefit of humanity. The procedure itself was narrated my Sriman Narayana to Narada.
<br /><br />
Chapter 2 narrates the benefits of the puja. A poor Brahmin was approached by Lord Himself in disguise and He advised him of the puja. Upon successful completion of the puja, the Brahmin could overcome his difficulties and enjoy eternal bliss. It also narrates about the good fortune of a woodcutter who witnesses the Brahmin performing the puja and continues to gain prosperity after performing the puja.
<br /><br />
Chapter 3 narrates the mishaps that may occur for dishonoring the vow to perform the puja. A merchant, with an intention to establish family, vows to perform the puja upon having a child. He adjourns the vow to complete it during the child’s marriage. Upon forgetting the vow, the Lord puts the merchant in hardship. The merchant is falsely accused and imprisoned. His entire business is confiscated by the king. His household goes bankrupt. He is freed when his wife recollects the promise and performs the puja.
<br /><br />
Chapter 4 narrates about the Lord’s benevolence and the importance of the Prasad. This is a continuation of the previous chapter. During an incident, the merchant puts off the Lord about his merchandise, thereby losing all its value. Realizing his folly, the merchant regrets his intemperance and seeks forgiveness. On hearing that the merchant reached the dockyard, his wife and daughter, who were performing the puja at that time, forget to take the Prasad. Angered with the disrespect, He makes the boats sink into the sea, only to be restored when they have the Prasad.
<br /><br />
Chapter 5 narrates about the importance of the puja and not that of the devotees. A group of backwoodsmen was performing the puja. King discards and disregards the offerings, thereby invoking the wrath of Sri Satyanarayana. The king loses his kingdom, wealth, and family, only to be restored upon realizing his recklessness and seeking forgiveness to Sri Satyanarayana and accepting the offerings
<h2>Concluding the Puja: Arati & Stuti</h2>
The rituals concludes with the Puja participants including the story audience singing Invocation prayers (Aarti) to Satya Narayaṇa.
