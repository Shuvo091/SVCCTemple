<br /><br />
"Archana" means offering of Mangala dravyas (auspicious materials) to Devi as prescribed in the Shastras, along with the chanting of Mantras. "Mangala" means fulfillment of all good wishes and removal of all difficulties. Flowers, leaves, fruits, fragrant materials, etc are counted as Mangala dravyas, among all of them, "Kumkum" is the most sacred. Fruit or merit obtained by offering flowers such as Jasmine, Champak, Saugandhi, Kanakambara, Lotus, etc can be obtained by just offering of "Kumkum" only.
<br /><br />
Turmeric is the main basic material from which "Kumkum" is made. All forms of Purusharathas i.e. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha (Knowledge, health, longitivity, all kinds of riches, fame and prosperity in all aspects, liberation) are obtained by a person who performs Kumkumarchana to Devi. Its Phala i.e. merit is immeasurable if one perfoms Kumkumarchane along with the chanting of Lalita Sahasranama.
<br /><br />
Lalita Sahasranama forms a part of Lalitopakhanya which appears in the Bramhanda Purana. It was revealed to Maharishi Agatsaya by the Lord. Hayagriva only after Agatsaya was tested for many years and after he requested many times with upmost modesty. These thousand names of Devi were first composed and chanted by the "Eight Vagdevis" who are most close to Devi, on the command of Sri Devi Lalita herself. Among these thousand names the 684th name is "Rajarajeshwari". To this name Rajarajeshwari, when "Om Sri" and "Namaha" are added before and after respectively, the mantra "Om Sri Rajarajeshwaryai Namah" is formed. If one perofrms Kumkumarchana daily by chanting 108 times this Mantra, it is equal to the chanting of all the Sahasranamas of all Devatas put together.
<br /><br />
The Divine mother has descended on this Bhumandala (earth) in different places assuming different names. Thes places are known as "Sixty four Shakti Peethas", "Sharada" of Shringeri, "Kamakshi" of Kanchi, "Meenakshi" of Madurai, "Vishalakshi" of Kashi, "Kamakhya" of Assam, "Jnanakshi" of Kalyanapuri (Bangalore) are some of the Shakti Peethas.
<br /><br />
In this century for the benefit of Bhaktas, the founder of Sri Kailash Ashrama Mahasamsthana, His Holiness Videha Kaivalya Mukta Brahmaleena Param Pujya Srimatparamahamsa Pariwajakacharya Sachidananda Pranavaswarupa Paramacharya Jagadguru Sri Sri Sri Shivaratnapuri Bhagavatpadacharya Sri Sri Sri Tiruchi Mahaswamiji with his Tapashakti, Devi has presided at Bangalore "Jaya Peetha" as "Sri Jnanakshi Rajajrajeshwari". It is said in the "Tantra Chudamani" that this place forms the "Karnabhaga" or ear of the numerous Shaktipeethas in Bharat. This Peetha has been called as "Jaya Peetha" and presiding Bhairava is "Abiru Bhairava".
<br /><br />
Akhilandakoti Bramhanda Nayaki, Jaganmata, Sri Jnanakshi Rajajrajeshwari Devi, the Divine Mother of the universe, surrounded by the mighty Himalayas, Champaka garden, lake of nector, etc, assuming the throne at the Jaya Peetha (one of the 64 Shakti Peethas) as Karnatakeshwari (Bengaluru) in Kanchanapura (Kenchanahalli) in the glorious state of Karnataka, is showering boundless grace on the fourteen worlds.
<br /><br />
In this sacred Kshetra, the great ascetic couple Rishi Atri and Anasuya, who had their Ashrama at this place where Sri Rajarajeshwari temple is situated today, have received the grace of Divine Mother after offering devout worship to Sri Rajarajeshwari. Bhu-Devi(Mother Earth), Surya Devata (Sun God), Asta Nagas (serpents) and other Devatas, Devarishi Narada, Rishi Agastya and other great sages have worshipped Devi and have been blessed by her. Many other saints too have worshipped Devi, meditated upon her at this very place and have been endowed with Atmajnana (self knowledge), at the very spot where the present temple Garbha Griha (Sanctum - Sanctorum) is situated. Devi's 6 feet Krishnashila Vigraha (idol) is installed at the place where ancient Devi Sri Rajarajeshwari metal sculpture was discovered.
<br /><br />
There are two basic requirements for fulfillment of human life "Bhoga-Lokakshema" (all worldly requirements) and "Moksha" (liberation from all bondages).
<br /><br />
It is said that wherever Devi has her left leg unfolded and rests below, there prosperity of all kinds will be complete and wherever Devi has her right leg unfolded and rests below, there knowledge and liberation will be complete.
<br /><br />
At JayaPeetha Devi has her right leg folded and her left leg unfolded which rests on the lotus pedestal, so all worldly wishes (Bhoga-Lokakshema) are fulfilled. A person who performs Kumkumarchane of Devi with the chanting of mantra "Om Sri Jnanakshi Rajarajeshwaryai Namaha", along with Devi's Divine blessings even his worldly wishes are fulfilled.
<br /><br />
Lalita Sahasranama can be chanted by a person who has received "Upasesha" from a guru or a person who knows Lalita Sahasranama. Lalita Sahasranama chanting can be done by all human beings without the restriction of age, sex, caste and creed. There is not a single person on this Bhumandala (earth) who is not eligible to perform Lalita Sahasranama chanting and Kumkumarchana.
<br /><br />
"Kumkum" obtained by offering Kumkum to Devi after Kumkumarchana is the Divine prasad of Devi, so every person can perform Kumkumarchane and apply kumkum on forehead. This kumkum is not a sign of "Grihastha Ashrama" (marital status), but this kumkum is only the Divya Prasad of Devi.
