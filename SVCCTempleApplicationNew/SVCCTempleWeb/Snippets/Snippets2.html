    <h2>Bhakti Snippet 2</h2>
    When Vyasa was sitting frustrated, Sage Narada visited him at his hermitage. Hearing about Vyasa,s frustration, Narada says, "I consider that wisdom to be deficient, which does not tend to praise the Lord. You have not fully described the glory of Bhagavan Vasudeva in Mahabharata and other such works as you have done about Dharma, Ardha etc." He also advised Vyasa to sing the glory of Shri Hari. This inspired Vyasa to create the great work of Srimad Bhagavatam, which is an epic of various Leelas of Lord Narayana. We will be discussing the episodes of Srimad Bhagavatam one by one.
